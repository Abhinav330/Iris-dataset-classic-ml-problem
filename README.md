# Irish-dataset-classic-ml-problem
This repository demonstrates the classification of Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.


1. **Data Preparation:** Loads the Iris dataset and performs necessary preprocessing.
2. **Data Exploration:** Visualizes the data to understand relationships between features and species.
3. **Model Training:** Trains an SVM classifier on the training data.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like confusion matrix and classification report.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizes the SVM model using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.

This project provides a practical example of using SVM for multi-class classification tasks.
